# ðŸ“š On the Study of ML Cloud Service Misuses: An Industrial Perspective

Welcome to the replication package of our paper **On the Study of ML Cloud Service Misuses: An Industrial Perspective**! ðŸš€ This repository compiles all results from the systematic review of literature, mining of GitHub repositories, and analysis of survey responses. It aims to uncover trends, patterns, and insights across multiple software development and research projects.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Contents

This repository contains the following resources:

### 1. ðŸ“„ **Papers Collected from the Systematic Literature Review**
   - A collection of research papers and publications gathered during the systematic literature review: [here](https://github.com/ml-service-misuses/Replication_Package/blob/main/Papers%20set.pdf)

### 2. ðŸ’» **GitHub Repositories Mined**
   - A curated collection of GitHub repositories related to the research topics: ML services and antipatterns.
   - These repositories were mined using Python scripts based on keywords found in the README/description of each repository.
   - In-depth information on the GitHub repositories, including: descriptions, contributors, number of stars, and forks.

### 3. ðŸ“Š **Results of the Analysis of GitHub Projects**
   - This analysis identifies commonalities and misuses across the projects: [here](https://github.com/ml-service-misuses/Replication_Package/blob/main/ML%20Service%20misuses-occurrence.pdf)
